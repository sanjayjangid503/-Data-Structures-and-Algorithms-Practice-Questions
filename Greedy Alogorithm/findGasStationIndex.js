// Problem Description
// There are N gas stations positioned along a circular race track.

// Given a gas[] array, at the ith gas station, a race car can fill up a maximum of gas[i] units of gas.

// Given a burn[] array, the race car needs burn[i] units of gas to go from gas station i to gas station (i+1) in circular fashion.

// You have a race car with unlimited tank capacity. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the i gas stations. You need to print the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the racetrack (in a right circular direction in the array) and finish at the station where you started. If you cannot find any such gas station, return -1.

// Note: If there are multiple solutions, print the minimum such index.

// Input format
// First line will contain a single integer N.

// Next line will contain N space separated values representing the gas array.

// Next line will contain N space separated values representing the burn array.

// Output format
// Print a single integer. Consider 1-based indexing.

// Constraints
// 1 <= N <= 200000

// 1 <= burn[i],gas[i] <= 1000000

// Sample Input 1
// 5

// 5 1 2 3 4

// 4 2 3 1 5

// Sample Output 1
// 4

// Explanation 1
// Consider 1 based indexing.

// Starting from index 4, you can fill up 3 units of gas in the tank.

// When you travel from index 4 to index 5, you will have 2 units of gas left since you would burn 1 unit. You can fill up 4 units of gas at index 5, ending up with 2 + 4 = 6 units

// When you go from index 5 to index 1 (circular track), you will have 1 unit of gas left since you would burn 5 units. You can fill up 5 units of gas at index 1, ending up with 1 + 5 = 6 units

// When you go from index 1 to index 2, you will have 2 units of gas left since you would burn 4 units. You can fill up 1 unit of gas at index 2, ending up with 2 + 1 = 3 units

// When you go from index 2 to index 3, you will have 1 unit of gas left since you would burn 2 units. You can fill up 2 units of gas at index 3, ending up with 1 + 2 = 3 units

// You can finally go from index 3 to index 4 since you have 3 units of gas and the burn factor is 3. You will be left with 0 gas as you get back to index 4, but you are able to complete a full circle of the track starting at index 4, so the answer is 4.

// Sample Input 2
// 3

// 3 4 3

// 4 3 4

// Sample Output 2
// -1

// Explanation 2
// You cannot choose any position such that you can complete a full circle of the track. So the answer is -1.
